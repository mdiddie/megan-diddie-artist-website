      <h1>
       Megan Diddie is a Chicago based artist working with video, animation,
       drawing, and ceramics. Some of the themes that cycle through her work
       include human physiology, plants, systems, landscape, and digestion. She aims
       to capture the idea that in hope there is both complexity and darkness;
       which for her inspires a more nuanced and honest examination of the human world.
       <br>
       <br>
       She has a curatorial practice running Final Resting Place gallery with Tim Hogan.
