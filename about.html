        Megan Diddie (b. 1985, Los Angeles, CA) is a Chicago-based artist working with drawing, animation, video, and paper-making. Her work explores relationships between human bodies, plants, landscapes, and built environments. Drawing is at the heart of her practice. For Diddie, drawing is a language used to work through ideas, curiosities, and messages from the unconscious. Many of these ideas come from a need to describe discomfort and anxiety through both representational and abstract forms. Her work with video and animation elaborates upon the drawings and is a tool for complicating ideas and refining stories. She likes to imbue a sense of humor, play, and sensuality to each piece. Material exploration of paper has been a huge part of her practice. Her work with handmade paper and fiber exploration has ranged from sculptures to artist books. Working with local fibers from prairies and agriculture, she is interested in how materials can be embedded into ideas as well as the art making process. 


       <!-- Megan Diddie is a Chicago based artist working with video, animation,
       drawing, and ceramics. Some of the themes that cycle through her work
       include human physiology, plants, systems, landscape, and digestion. She aims
       to capture the idea that in hope there is both complexity and darkness;
       which for her inspires a more nuanced and honest examination of the human world. -->
