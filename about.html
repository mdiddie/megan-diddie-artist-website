        Megan Diddie is a visual artist working with mixed media on paper,
       video, animation, artist books and zines. She has a curatorial practice
       running Final Resting Place gallery with Tim Hogan.
       In her art practice human physiology, plants, systems, landscape, and
       digestion are some of the threads that cycle through her work. She aims
       to capture the idea that in hope there is both complexity and darkness;
       which for her inspires a more nuanced and honest examination of the human world.
